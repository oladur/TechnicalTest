The front End task of the Technical test was what I worked on 

Familiarize yourself with the UI.
1. Using a BDD approach, build a small automated test framework, and then choose and write 5 user acceptance tests focused on the functionality of the application.
2. Suppose you want to run some of these tests in a development pipeline that's independent from the backend development pipeline. Explain how you would approach this:
- What techniques, frameworks or tools you might think of using;
- How you would go about integrating this framework with a CI pipeline;
